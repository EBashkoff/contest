<p>Dear <%= get_first_name(@resource.name) %>,</p>

<div>
  <p>
    Thank you for agreeing to judge the 2015 EDDY Awards! We’re thrilled
    you’ll be
    helping recognize the wonderful work produced by independent publishers who
    make up Edible Communities.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below are the links to entries we’d like for you to view and judge. Please
    reply to this email by (lucky) Friday, February 13 with your favorite
    selection from each category with a sentence or two that describes what you
    especially like about the piece. We’ll also need you to select a runner up
    in
    each category and provide a soundbite as well. While the list of links may
    look long, many of the entries require just a few minutes. Feature, Story
    and
    Special Issue categories involve more reading while Recipe and Imagery
    categories are quick views of visuals.
  </p>

  <p>
    Depending on your browser, each link will either open up a new window or
    tab
    or potentially even download the PDF or jpeg to your computer. If you
    experience any problems viewing your entries, please email
    <a href="mailto:eddyawards@ediblemedia.com">eddyawards@ediblemedia.com</a> to let us know.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once again, thanks so much for being a crucial part of the EDDY Awards.
    Please
    quickly reply to this email so we know you received it.
  </p>

  <p>
    My best,<br/>Lara Bashkoff
  </p>

  <p>
    Chief Digital Officer, Edible Media<br/>
    <a href="mailto:lara@ediblemedia.com">lara@ediblemedia.com</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    P.S. Your selections will help determine 5 finalists in each category,
    which
    will be posted to <a href="ediblefeast.com">ediblefeast.com</a> for Readers’ Choice voting on Monday,
    February 22. Your vote will also inform Critics’ Choice winners. All winners
    will be revealed online on Friday, March 20.
